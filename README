You need a locally running instance of MongoDB and / or MySQL to get the integration tests and web application to function properly.

MongoDB server is very small. Don't be intimidated. You can download MongoDB @
http://www.mongodb.org/ 

MySQL is also a small footprint database installation available @
http://www.mysql.com/

To make the application run on a local installation of MongoDB: 
1) Copy the file WebContent/WEB-INF/mongodb/partient-registrar-servlet.xml to the WebContent/WEB-INF directory
2) Start the MongoDB host process (bin/mongod.exe in the MongoDB installation directory)
3) Start JEE server

To make the application run on a local installation of MySQL:
1) Copy the file WebContent/WEB-INF/mysql/partient-registrar-servlet.xml to the WebContent/WEB-INF directory
