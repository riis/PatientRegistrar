You need a locally running instance of MongoDB and MySQL to get the integration tests and web application to run properly.

MongoDB server is very small. Don't be intimidated. You can download MongoDB @
http://www.mongodb.org/ 

MySQL is also a small relational database; installation available @
http://www.mysql.com/

To run the web application: 
1) Start MySQL (bin/mysqld.exe in the MySQL installation directory)
2) In MySQL, execute the DDL @ WebContent/WEB-INF/mysql/mysql.ddl
3) Start the MongoDB host process (bin/mongod.exe in the MongoDB installation directory)
4) Start JEE server
